##Memory Game

#### by Jason Booras

Match the *Peanuts* characters to win, you only have four guesses, choose wisely. You can restart the game by clicking the title, but the game will automatically restart if you win or loose.

This simple memory game uses *JavaScript* and *jQuery* to manipulate *HTML* elements.
